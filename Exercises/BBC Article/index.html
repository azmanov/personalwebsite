  <h1>Celebrating one amazing year on Earth</h1>

  
  <h4>Each day on this planet, something amazing happens</h4>
  
  <p> BBC Earth online is one year old today, first appearing on 16 September, 2014</p>
  
  <p>
    In the past year we've had the honour of celebrating our wonderful planet, and have been honoured ourselves with a <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2015/websites/general-website/science/bbc-earth/"> People's Voice Webby Award for the Best Science Website on the Internet. </a>. And to cleberate our first year, we've made this rather special film.
