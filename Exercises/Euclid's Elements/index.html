        The 13 books of The Elements, in which Euclid presented staggering and beautiful truths in the disciplines of geometry and number theory, have had an inestimable influence on civilization.

        There are famous anecdotes concerning Euclid's philosphy. After proving the proposition in a course, a student asked Euclid what practical use the material would provide. Euclid gave the student a coin and sent him away, since he clearly required recompense from knowledge rather than learning simply for the sake of learning. When Ptolemy I asked Euclid to provide him with a simpler means to grasp the theorems, Euclid replied, There is no royal road to geometry

        <span class=red> Euclid was a Greek mathematician </span> who lived and taught in Alexandria around 300 BC. He is revered not only for his specific theorems concerning triangles, circles and prime numbers, but for his entire approach to mathematical thought in providing definitions, identifying the postulates being assumed, then carrying forward the logical consequences of those basic assumptions, lemma by lemma, theorem by theorem. He provided a methodology for mathematical reasoning that served as an inspiration for the next 22 centuries of geometry instruction throughout the world. Although much of his most celebrated, 13-book work, <i> The Elements</i>, concerns geometry (in Book I Euclid proves the Pythagorean theorem, while he explains the constructions of the five Platonic solids in book XIII), Euclid made a three-book excursion into number theory. In Book VII he explains how to find the greates common divisor of two integers, detailing an algorithm that bears his name. In Book IX he returns to the Pythagorean theorem and provides a formula that generates whole numbers whose squares number, such as 3<sup>2</sup>+4<sup>2</sup>=5<sup>2</sup>, giving lengths of sides of a right-angled triangle.
