                    This might not be worthy of a blog post, but I am really excited about this so here we go:
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I finally got around to fixing my laptop! The poor thing.. I had been using it with an external keyboard for way long.... Anyway, I was gonna put it off until the holidays because the challenge seemed daunting and the take-apart guide was 40 pages, but since school was canceled for a second day in a row because of the terrorist threat, I finally got around to doing it. I guess there's a positive side even to religious extremism!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For a long time I was the only kid in my class that didn't own his own laptop. This only became a problem when we started using laptops in the classroom. My mom then spilled coffee on hers and gave it to me (Thanks, mom!). I quickly got rid of the nasty scum that is the Mac OS X operating system and installed Fedora 22. It was almost perfect. I then realized that I did have a shot at fixing the keyboard. The problem was, the way these things are built means that you need to take apart everything before getting to the keyboard which had to be replaced. I also had to buy the stupid proprietary screwdrivers that Apple makes for some goddamn reason (they're star-shaped! STAR SHAPED!!!). I found cheap replicas for about 15$, so that was money well spent. Then I waited. And waited. I waited so, so long because I knew it would be extremely difficult. Maybe I was scared. So many things could go wrong. Then the terrorists came and I just went for it.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I Definitely learned a lot. First of all, it was the dirtiest thing in the world. Dust, crumbs, you name it. It was a harder task cleaning the thing than actually fixing it. Here are some pics of the dissasembly. I was pleasantly surprised, as it ended up being much easier than I thought. I often spent 15 minutes gently trying to pull a cable out of a socket, scared to rip it out and ruin the computer, and then finding out that using sheer force was literally the only way. When I finished, I thought surely something must have gone wrong. There was not way in hell that I did not make a mistake. And then:

                    This Competition started off amazing. It got cancelled on Saturday because of the terrorist threats brussels has been having. Daesh is getting a bit annoying, am I right? It's kind of funny how the chemistry competition was cancelled because of explosion threats. Haha.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I am glad to inform everyone that EEB4 has claimed glory yet

                    again, by finishing second at the ESSS in Munich. I would like to

                    share the thrill, if not the glory, with everyone by recounting the

                    experience I had at Munich with my team of uncannily talented,

                    and freakishly lucky students (Isabelle Sabeva, Ioana Sabau, and

                    me - Victor Elgersma).
                  </p>

                    Instead of telling you how great our project was, I will be frank

                    and say that nearly everything went wrong. We got very excited

                    last summer about participating in this event, but when we started

                    coming up with ideas, we immediately hit a brick wall. After

                    scrutinizing the criteria, we decided to go with something we

                    deemed “significant”. Since global warming is such a hot (get it?) topic, we

                    wanted to plunge into a project related to it. Here’s the thing

                    about creativity: You can spend weeks thinking and thinking and

                    not coming up with anything, but an idea can also hit you

                    completely out of the blue. But it didn’t hit us. So, in the total

                    absence of a ‘eureka’ moment, we decided to go with the most

                    obvious choice: investigating how a rise in temperature affects

                    plants. Trivial, isn’t it? We naively decided to go for this

                    experiment even though we had absolutely no access to growth

                    chambers of any kind (to control the temperature). Second brick

                    wall: It turned out that it costs thousands of euros to rent a

                    growth chamber. Since renting was not an option, we almost gave

                    up on the experiment, until we emailed a bunch of people from the

                    VUB in a last attempt to get access to growth chambers. While

                    most people ignored us, one professor agreed to help us out.

                    Incredibly, we were allowed to use the growth chambers for free,

                    and we were also supplied with seeds and other equipment by the

                    university.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Just when it seemed like our project was actually going to work,

                    our experiment was utterly ruined. We had accidentally given our

                    plants twice the amount of water we were supposed to. Since

                    water was supposed to be a constant variable, this was a huge

                    problem. First came disbelief, then anger, then frustration. At this

                    point we were too invested in the experiment to quit, so we made

                    the best of it. After hours of deliberation, we were able to turn the

                    mistake into an advantage which actually ended up making our

                    experiment much more interesting. We grew another group of

                    plants, and the plants in the “failed” group allowed us to isolate

                    the effect of temperature from the effect of humidity, as a rise in

                    temperature naturally leads to higher levels of evaporation (which

                    leads to lower humidity)

                    The trip to Munich, where the competition took place, lasted 4

                    days, and the European School of Munich provided a bunch of fun

                    activities. We visited a salt mine, saw BMW World, the Allianz

                    arena, and went bowling. Amazingly, ES Munich was even able to

                    squeeze in some scientific activities as well. After presenting our

                    projects to a 2-person jury (a physicist and an engineer), the

                    finalists were announced. We then had the nerve-racking

                    experience of preparing to present the following day in front of the

                    entire jury and all the participants. All went well (despite me

                    forgetting a couple of lines, for which my teammates forgave me

                    way too easily) and the prizes were given out on the last day.

                    We would like to thank Mr Edelin for encouraging us throughout

                    the trip to Munich, Mr Mac Alister for being an awesome mentor,

                    and Bram Vancompernolle (a doctoral student at the VUB) for

                    helping us with the VUB laboratory. They would probably protest

                    and say that they were just doing their work. They were not. They

                    did go out of their way to keep us going, often despite the odds,

                    and despite our desire to quit. If there is anything we’ve learned

                    for sure from this experience, it is that brick walls are thinner than

                    they seem.
