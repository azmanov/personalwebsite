  We won!!! Second Place…
      </p>
      <p>
        I am glad to inform everyone that EEB4 has claimed glory yet 

        again, by finishing second at the ESSS in Munich. I would like to 

        share the thrill, if not the glory, with everyone by recounting the 

        experience I had at Munich with my team of uncannily talented, 

        and freakishly lucky students (Isabelle Sabeva, Ioana Sabau, and 

        me - Victor Elgersma).

        Instead of telling you how great our project was, I will be frank

        and say that nearly everything went wrong. We got very excited 

        last summer about participating in this event, but when we started 

        coming up with ideas, we immediately hit a brick wall. After 

        scrutinizing the criteria, we decided to go with something we 

        deemed “significant”. Since global warming is such a hot (get it?) topic, we 

        wanted to plunge into a project related to it. Here’s the thing 

        about creativity: You can spend weeks thinking and thinking and 

        not coming up with anything, but an idea can also hit you 

        completely out of the blue. But it didn’t hit us. So, in the total 

        absence of a ‘eureka’ moment, we decided to go with the most 

        obvious choice: investigating how a rise in temperature affects 

        plants. Trivial, isn’t it? We naively decided to go for this 

        experiment even though we had absolutely no access to growth 

        chambers of any kind (to control the temperature). Second brick 

        wall: It turned out that it costs thousands of euros to rent a 

        growth chamber. Since renting was not an option, we almost gave 

        up on the experiment, until we emailed a bunch of people from the 

        VUB in a last attempt to get access to growth chambers. While 

        most people ignored us, one professor agreed to help us out. 

        Incredibly, we were allowed to use the growth chambers for free, 

        and we were also supplied with seeds and other equipment by the 

        university.
          
      </p>
      <p>
        Just when it seemed like our project was actually going to work,

        our experiment was utterly ruined. We had accidentally given our 

        plants twice the amount of water we were supposed to. Since 

        water was supposed to be a constant variable, this was a huge 

        problem. First came disbelief, then anger, then frustration. At this 

        point we were too invested in the experiment to quit, so we made 

        the best of it. After hours of deliberation, we were able to turn the 

        mistake into an advantage which actually ended up making our 

        experiment much more interesting. We grew another group of 

        plants, and the plants in the “failed” group allowed us to isolate 

        the effect of temperature from the effect of humidity, as a rise in 

        temperature naturally leads to higher levels of evaporation (which 

        leads to lower humidity)

        The trip to Munich, where the competition took place, lasted 4

        days, and the European School of Munich provided a bunch of fun 

        activities. We visited a salt mine, saw BMW World, the Allianz 

        arena, and went bowling. Amazingly, ES Munich was even able to 

        squeeze in some scientific activities as well. After presenting our 

        projects to a 2-person jury (a physicist and an engineer), the 

        finalists were announced. We then had the nerve-racking 

        experience of preparing to present the following day in front of the 

        entire jury and all the participants. All went well (despite me 

        forgetting a couple of lines, for which my teammates forgave me 

        way too easily) and the prizes were given out on the last day.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to thank Mr Edelin for encouraging us throughout 

        the trip to Munich, Mr Mac Alister for being an awesome mentor, 

        and Bram Vancompernolle (a doctoral student at the VUB) for 

        helping us with the VUB laboratory. They would probably protest 

        and say that they were just doing their work. They were not. They 

        did go out of their way to keep us going, often despite the odds, 

        and despite our desire to quit. If there is anything we’ve learned 

        for sure from this experience, it is that brick walls are thinner than 

        they seem.
