                  <h2>
                    ESSS 2015
                  </h2>
                  <br>
                  <h5>After 7 months of hard work, I was extatic to hear we came second in the European School's Science Symposium in Munich </h5>
                  <br>

                  <p>
                    We won!!! Well, second place…              </p>

                  <p> I am glad to inform everyone that EEB4 has claimed glory yet again, by finishing second at the ESSS in Munich. I would like to share the thrill, if not the glory, with everyone by recounting the experience I had at Munich with my team of uncannily talented, and freakishly lucky students (Isabelle Sabeva, Ioana Sabau, and me - Victor Elgersma). </p>

                  <p> Instead of telling you how great our project was, I will be frank and say that nearly everything went wrong. We got very excited last summer about participating in this event, but when we started coming up with ideas, we immediately hit a brick wall. After scrutinizing the criteria, we decided to go with something we deemed “significant”. Since global warming is such a hot (get it?) topic, we wanted to plunge into a project related to it. Here’s the thing about creativity: You can spend weeks thinking and thinking and not coming up with anything, but an idea can also hit you completely out of the blue. But it didn’t hit us. So, in the total absence of a ‘eureka’ moment, we decided to go with the most obvious choice: investigating how a rise in temperature affects plants. Trivial, isn’t it? We naively decided to go for this experiment even though we had absolutely no access to growth chambers of any kind (to control the temperature). Second brick wall: It turned out that it costs thousands of euros to rent a growth chamber. Since renting was not an option, we almost gave up on the experiment, until we emailed a bunch of people from the VUB in a last attempt to get access to growth chambers. While most people ignored us, one professor agreed to help us out. Incredibly, we were allowed to use the growth chambers for free, and we were also supplied with seeds and other equipment by the university.                   </p>

                  <img src = assets/img/ESSS-1.png>
                  <p> Just when it seemed like our project was actually going to work, our experiment was utterly ruined. We had accidentally given our plants twice the amount of water we were supposed to. Since water was supposed to be a constant variable, this was a huge problem. First came disbelief, then anger, then frustration. At this point we were too invested in the experiment to quit, so we made the best of it. After hours of deliberation, we were able to turn the mistake into an advantage which actually ended up making our experiment much more interesting. We grew another group of plants, and the plants in the “failed” group allowed us to isolate the effect of temperature from the effect of humidity, as a rise in temperature naturally leads to higher levels of evaporation (which leads to lower humidity)                   </p>

                  <p> The trip to Munich, where the competition took place, lasted 4 days, and the European School of Munich provided a bunch of fun activities. We visited a salt mine, saw BMW World, the Allianz arena, and went bowling. Amazingly, ES Munich was even able to squeeze in some scientific activities as well. After presenting our projects to a 2-person jury (a physicist and an engineer), the finalists were announced. We then had the nerve-racking experience of preparing to present the following day in front of the entire jury and all the participants. All went well (despite me forgetting a couple of lines, for which my teammates forgave me way too easily) and the prizes were given out on the last day. </p>

                  <img src = assets/img/ESSS-2.jpg>

                  <p> We would like to thank Mr Edelin for encouraging us throughout the trip to Munich, Mr Mac Alister for being an awesome mentor, and Bram Vancompernolle (a doctoral student at the VUB) for helping us with the VUB laboratory. They would probably protest and say that they were just doing their work. They were not. They did go out of their way to keep us going, often despite the odds, and despite our desire to quit. If there is anything we’ve learned for sure from this experience, it is that brick walls are thinner than they seem. </p>
